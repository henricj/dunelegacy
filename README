The program Dune Legacy is an modernized clone of the excellent Westwood Studios game "Dune 2". It is ridiculusly easy to find
Dune2 on the net anyways, but I won't provide it.  I think you can still even buy it from Westwood studios, so do that.
There exists a mod called Superdune 2. The PAK-Files Superdune 2 provides are nearly the same except SCENARIO.PAK.
 
This program would not have been created without the use of the excellent SDL library and its extensions.  Thanks guys :).


Getting Started
---------------

The following PAK-files from the original Dune 2 are needed to play Dune Legacy:
	HARK.PAK
	ATRE.PAK
	ORDOS.PAK
	ENGLISH.PAK
	DUNE.PAK
	SCENARIO.PAK
	MENTAT.PAK
	VOC.PAK
	MERC.PAK
	FINALE.PAK
	INTRO.PAK
	INTROVOC.PAK
	SOUND.PAK
	GERMAN.PAK (for playing in German)
	FRENCH.PAK (for playing in French)

It depends on your system and installation where to put these files. LEGACY.PAK is supplied with Dune Legacy and is already
in the data directory. All the other files should be copied there too. If you are not allowed to copy files there you may
copy these files inside the dunelegacy configuration directory (e.g. ~/.config/dunelegacy/data/ on unix).

Linux:
It depends on how the game was compiled. Normally you should put these files under /usr/share/dunelegacy/ or /usr/local/share/dunelegacy/ .
Just look for LEGACY.PAK. If you do not have root access to your system you should put them in your home directory under ~/.config/dunelegacy/data/ .

Windows:
The installer has already asked for the files and put them in the installation directory. If not put the PAK-files inside your installation folder or 
if you do not have administrator privileges you should put them to C:\Documents and Settings\<YourName>\Application Data\dunelegacy\data\ .


MAC OS X:
The PAK-files have to be copied inside the application bundle. If you have followed the steps in the supplied dmg you have already copied them there.
Otherwise just right-click on the bundle and select "Show Bundle Content". Then navigate into "Contents" and then into "Resources". There you will 
find LEGACY.PAK. Put the other PAK-files there too. Alternativly you can put them in your home directory under ~/.config/dunelegacy/data/ but putting 
them inside the application bundle is the preferred way.

Configuration file
------------------

If you want to fine tune the configuration of Dune Legacy you might want to take a look at the configuration file "Dune Legacy.ini". Depending on your system it 
is either placed in ~/.config/dunelegacy (on Linux), ~/Library/Application Support/Dune Legacy (on Mac OS X) or in C:\Documents and Settings\<YourName>\Application Data\dunelegacy\ (on Windows).


Internet Game
-------------

To play online via Internet you have to manually enable port forwarding if you use a NAT Router. Forward the Dune Legacy Server Port (Default is 28747) from your NAT Router to your computer. Use the same port on your router as configured in Dune Legacy.
Example: If your machine has IP 192.168.123.1 and your using the default Dune Legacy Port, than forward port 28747 from your router to 192.168.123.1:28747.
