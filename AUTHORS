Dune Legacy has been written by many people. e.g.:
 Anthony Cole (anthonycole81AThotmail.com.au) - started this great game
 Olaf van der Spek
 Raal Goff (gumbyATleemingwireless.net)
 Stefen Hendriks - random map generator: MapGenerator.cpp
 Richard Schaller (richard.schallerATgmx.de) - current developer

Graphics, Sound and other data:
Most of the graphics and sounds are loaded from the Dune II pak files (which are not part of Dune Legacy) during the start of the game.
Some of the shipped icons (mostly those used in the map editor) are from the tango icon theme which is public domain.
All other graphics are contributions to Dune Legacy and are under the same license as Dune Legacy.
The only exception are the maps which are under CC-BY-SA.
