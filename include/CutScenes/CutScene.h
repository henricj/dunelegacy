/// A base class for running Dune 2 Cutscenes.
/**
    This class runs a Dune 2 Cutscene. The cutscene is composed of video elements with aditional audio and text elements. The video
    is managed by subclasses of VideoEvent. The list if VideoEvents determines the length of the video. TextEvents and CutSceneTriggers
    (CutSceneMusicTrigger or CutSceneSoundTrigger) can be linked in at specific framenumbers. The whole video is split up in scenes to
    make it easier to debug the exact timings of TextEvents and CutSceneTriggers. The timings for both are given relative to the start of
    the last scene.
